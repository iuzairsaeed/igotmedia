            <h3>Security of Personal Information</h3>
            <p>The information of our clients is secure, as it is protected during transmission by the use of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Software which encrypts the information the client puts in.</p>
            
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at <a href="mailto:info@IGOT Media.com">info@IGOT Media.com</a></p>

            <h3>Access of Registered Accounts</h3>
            <p>The client can access their registered accounts by signing in on our homepage. Once signed in, the client has access to their previous lists and information that they have already submitted to the site. The users are able to update their information once they have logged in to their accounts by clicking My Account.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="margin-bottom-20">
            <h3>Changing &amp; Deleting/Unsubscribing Accounts</h3>
            <p>The client has to send in an email to request the cancellation of subscription or request to have their personal information deleted. This shall prevent the user from receiving e-mails communication relating to any online order they might have placed at the site.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="margin-bottom-20">
            <h3>Cookies and Their Use</h3>
            <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to the clients' hard drives through their Web browsers. This enables our systems to recognize the clients' browsers and storage of items in their Shopping Carts during visits.</p>
            <p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will be more helpful in explaining how to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify the user when a new cookie is received, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the top features at our site, and our company's personal recommendation is that the client leaves them to be accepted.</p>
            <p>Second, we keep track of your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your location and your Internet service provider. We may also collect combined information on how our users are utilizing the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site and search queries. No IP address/log file information is tied to Personally Identifiable Information (PII).</p>
            <p>Third, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to our site and URLs viewed by visitors while on our site. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in combined form.</p>
            <p>The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>

            <h3>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h3>
            <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
